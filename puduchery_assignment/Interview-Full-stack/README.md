### Background

This exercise is to test your fullstack skills. You have to take the following requirements and convert them to an Event booking application.

### Requirements: Event booking application

#### Application details

- Create an application that lists events and the ability to book tickets for that event.
- The application has 2 pages - event listing and event booking.
- The application should be mobile responsive.

#### Event Listing

- There is a search input on the top of the listing with placeholder - “SEARCH EVENTS”.
- The events are listed in a grid of 4 columns (single column in mobile view).
- Each event block has a name, image, date of the event, the number of seats available for the event and "Book Now" button.
- The events data is fetched from a JSON file through an HTTP request. This could be a local JSON file.
- Events start filtering as soon as the user starts entering letters in the Search input.
- The search is done only on the name of the event, on all the events(independent of the availability of the seats)
- If the search doesn't produce results, "No results found!" is displayed in the listing area.
- In the event block, if seats are available, "Book Now" button is shown. On clicking the "Book Now" button of an event, the user is redirected to the Event booking page.
- If the seats are not available for the event, there should be no "Book Now" button on the event block. In place of "Book Now" button, "Sold Out" text is shown.

#### Event Booking

- The header of the page should be the name of the event.
- Below the header, the number of available seats is displayed with the label - "Number of available seats".
- Below is the booking form that includes the following fields:
  |Field |Field Label |Validation |Validation Message |

- There are two buttons - Submit and Cancel, below the fields.
- If the Cancel button is clicked, the user is taken back to the listing page.
- If the Submit button is clicked, the following processes should take place:
  - If any validation fails, the validation message as given in the table is shown below each field where there is a validation error.
  - If all names are not provided for the selected number of seats, an error should appear below each name field which is not provided.
    - If there is no error, the form is successfully submitted and a message is shown below the header - "Tickets booked". Disable Submit and Cancel buttons.
    - Data is logged to the page and console
